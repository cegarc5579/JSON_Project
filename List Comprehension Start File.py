'''List comprehensions provide a concise way to create lists. 

It consists of brackets containing an expression followed by a for clause, then
zero or more for or if clauses. The expressions can be anything, meaning you can
put in all kinds of objects in lists.

The result will be a new list resulting from evaluating the expression in the
context of the for and if clauses which follow it. 

The list comprehension always returns a result list. '''


'''
new_list = []
for i in old_list:
    if filter(i):
        new_list.append(expressions(i))  '''

#You can obtain the same thing using list comprehension:

# new_list = [expression(i) for i in old_list if filter(i)]


#The list comprehension starts with a '[' and ']', to help you remember that the
#result is going to be a list.

# [ expression for item in list if conditional ]

# This is equivalent to:

'''for item in list:
    if conditional:
        expression '''
		
		


#Which corresponds to:

#*result*  = [*transform*    *iteration*         *filter*     ]

#The filter part answers the question if the item should be transformed. '''

#classic way 
from audioop import mul


old_list = [1,2,3,4,5]
new_list = []

for i in old_list:
    i = i**2
    new_list.append(i)

print(new_list)

#this is the list comprehension way

new_list = [i**2 for i in old_list]
print(new_list)


#1) creating a simple list of 10 numbers using Range()
x = [i for i in range (10)]
print(x)
# Output -[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]





#2) creating a list that evaluates an expression

squares = [x**2 for x in range(10)]
print(squares)

# Output -[0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]


#3) creating a list from another list
#[expression, iteration, condition]
list1 = [3,4,5] #this is old list we are grabbing numbers from 
multiplied = [item*3 for item in list1] #this is the new list that grabs from list 1
print(multiplied)
#[9,12,15]



# 4) using list comprehension for string manipulation

listofWords = ['this','is','a','list','of','words']
items = [x[0] for x in listofWords] #this goes through each one and x0 means the first letter in each word
print(items)


# Output - ['t', 'i', 'a', 'l', 'o', 'w']


# 5) Let's show how easy you can convert lower case / upper case letters.

lower = [x.lower() for x in ['A','B','C']]
print(lower)

upper = [x.upper() for x in lower]
print(upper)

#Output 1 - ['a', 'b', 'c']
# Output 2 - ['A', 'B', 'C']


#6) Creating a list based on a condition

new_range = [i*i for i in range(5)if i % 2 ==0] #in range 5 starts at 0. if a number is divisible by 2 with no remainder then it will come out in the list 
print(new_range)
#Output - [0, 4, 16]


# 7) Extracting numbers only from a string and putting it in a list
string = "Hello 12345 World"
newlist = [x for x in string if x.isdigit()] #isalpha to pull out letters from a line of string
print(newlist) 
alpha = [x for x in string if x.isalpha()]
print(alpha)


# Output - ['1', '2', '3', '4', '5']

''' 
In this example, we can see how to get specific lines out from a text file. 

Create a text file and put in some text in it. 

this is line1
this is line2
this is line3
this is line4
this is line5

Save the file as test.txt '''


fl = open("test.txt", 'r')
result = [i.strip("\n") for i in fl if 'line3' in i]
print(result)


#Output: ['this is line3']



#9) Using functions in list comprehension

# Create a function and name it double:
def double(x):
    return x * 2

# If you now just print that function with a value in it, it should look like this:

print(double(10))



# Answer - 20


#We can easily use list comprehension on that function.


output = [double(x) for x in range(10)]
print(output)


# Output - [0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18]




# 10) adding an IF condition to the above


output = [double(x) for x in range(10) if x %2 ==0] #expression, iteration, condition
print(output)


# Output - [0, 4, 8, 12, 16]


# 11) You can add more arguments (using multiple iterators and lists):

answer = [x+y for x in [10,20,30] for y in [20,40,60]] #each value of x is added to each value of y 
print(answer)




# Output - [30, 50, 70, 50, 70, 90, 70, 90, 110]
